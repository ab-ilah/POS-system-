/**
 * Staff permission matrix for the clothing-store POS.
 *
 * The React app imports this file directly (`shared/permissions.matrix.ts`).
 * Keep it self-contained: no imports. The names it relies on are
 * `PERMISSIONS_MATRIX` (rows with `decision`), `ROLES`, and the types
 * `Role`, `TableName`, `Operation`, `Decision`, and `PermissionRow`.
 *
 * Adding a role: extend `ROLES`, add a block in `ACCESS`, add a seed user, and
 * add matching policies. The booleans are table-level. Row scope that a boolean
 * cannot express is in `PERMISSION_SCOPE_NOTES` and enforced in the SQL policies.
